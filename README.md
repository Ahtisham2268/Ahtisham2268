## 🚀 My Tech Journey
From the early days of HTML and CSS to exploring the depths of Python and C++, I’ve been on a constant journey to push my limits. Here’s what my journey looks like right now:

1. **The Beginning:** Started with simple web development, building static sites, and playing around with JavaScript.
2. **Learning to Code:** Jumped into Python for data structures, algorithms, and fell in love with solving problems.
3. **Getting Serious with C++:** Learning how to create efficient, optimized code for real-world applications.
4. **Game Dev and Unity:** Building 2D/3D games to understand game physics, logic, and design.
5. **Reverse Engineering Noob:** Trying to pick apart programs to learn their secrets—will master this skill someday!
